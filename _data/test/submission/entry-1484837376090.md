The dramatic increase in the popularity of video games\r\nhas resulted in significant interest in the effects that video gaming may have on the brain and behavior. The scientific research\r\nto date indicates that some, but not all, commercial video games do indeed have the potential to cause large-scale changes\r\nin a wide variety of aspects of human behavior, including the focus of this review—cognitive abilities. More recent years\r\nhave seen the rise of a separate form of video games, the so-called “brain games,” or games designed with the explicit goal\r\nof enhancing cognitive abilities. Although research on such brain games is still in its infancy, and the results have definitely\r\nnot been uniformly positive, there is nonetheless reason for continued optimism that custom games can be developed that\r\nmake a lasting and positive impact on human cognitive skills. Here, we discuss the current state of the scientific literature\r\nsurrounding video games and human cognition with an emphasis on points critically related to public policy"
